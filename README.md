### MediaPipe
MediaPipe Face Detection is an ultrafast face detection solution that comes with 6 landmarks and multi-face support. It is based on BlazeFace, a lightweight and well-performing face detector tailored for mobile GPU inference. The detector's super-realtime performance enables it to be applied to any live viewfinder experience that requires an accurate facial region of interest as an input for other task-specific models, such as 3D facial keypoint or geometry estimation (e.g., MediaPipe Face Mesh), facial features or experession classification, and face region segmentation. BlazeFace uses a lightweight feature extraction network inspired by, but distinct from MobileNetV1/V2, a GPU-frinedly anchor scheme modified from Single Shot MultiBox Detector (SSD), and an improved tie resolution strategy alternative to non-maximum suppression.
